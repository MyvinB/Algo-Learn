Q Difference between arraylist and linked list
Arraylist
get(int index) gives performance of O(1)
Removal operation performance in worst case is O(n) and best case is O(1)	R
Add method gives performance of O(n) in worst case
linkedlist
get(int index) gives performance of O(n)
Removal operation gives performance of O(1)
Add method gives performance of O(1)
LinkedList uses a linked representation. Each object holds a link to the next element. Hence, insertion
and deletion are faster than ArrayList. But searching is slower.
